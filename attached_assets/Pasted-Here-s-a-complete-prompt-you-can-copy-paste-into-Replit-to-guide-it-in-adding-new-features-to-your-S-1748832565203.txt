🚀 Enhance My Streamlit Startup Generator App

I have a working Streamlit app that generates a startup name and a brief overview based on a selected category like HealthCare, EdTech, IT, or E-commerce. The app uses LangChain and Groq (LLaMA 3) behind the scenes.

I want you to help me add these new AI-powered features using LangChain prompts and Streamlit UI components:

🔧 New Features to Add:

1. 📍 Ideal Location Generator

Suggest the best city/country to launch the startup.

Criteria: demand, startup ecosystem, funding availability, etc.

Prompt example:
“Suggest the best city/country to launch a {category} startup where customer reach, startup ecosystem, and growth opportunities are high.”



2. 💰 Cost Estimator

Generate a breakdown of estimated costs including:

Initial setup

Labour/staff salaries

Infrastructure

Marketing


Prompt example:
“Give an approximate cost breakdown to start a {category} startup, including setup, salaries, tools, and marketing. Give numbers in USD.”



3. 📊 Target Audience Insight

Describe the ideal customer for the selected startup category.

Include: age group, profession, location, and behavior.



4. 🧠 Tech Stack or Tool Suggestions

Recommend tech stacks or SaaS tools needed for this kind of startup.



5. 💼 Business Model

Suggest suitable monetization strategies (e.g., freemium, SaaS, subscriptions).



6. 🧑‍💻 Competitor Analysis

List 2–3 known competitors with one-line differences.



7. 📅 Launch Roadmap

Provide a 6-month startup roadmap with monthly milestones.

⚙️ Technical Notes:

Use LangChain's PromptTemplate and LLMChain for each feature.

Organize them in a reusable helper file like langchain_helper.py.

Use SequentialChain only if outputs from one feature are needed as inputs to another.

On the frontend (main.py):

Use st.expander or st.tabs to neatly display each feature.

Auto-run all chains when a category is selected.

Clearly label each result with emojis and section titles.

Please add these features cleanly. You can improve the UX too if you want (e.g., use icons, colors, or collapsible sections).
Make sure it works inside Replit with no errors, and that it's all in one working repo. ✅

Would you like me to generate the updated code files (main.py, langchain_helper.py) for this now so you can directly paste them into Replit?
